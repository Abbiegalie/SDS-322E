## Question 1:

### 1.1 (2 pts) 

##### Load the ggplot2 package, which contains the mpg dataset. It contains data from 38 popular car models in 1999 and in 2008. Using ggplot, make a histogram of `hwy` (EPA highway miles-per-gallon). Then, in a separate plot, use `stat_ecdf()` to make a cumulative density plot of the same variable. The bimodal distribution is most clear in the histogram, but how can you see it in the cumulative density plot?  Eyeballing the cumulative density plot, approximately what proportion of cars have a highway mpg of 20 or less? (if you want, confirm your suspicions by using mean on a logical vector). 


```{R}
library(ggplot2)

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mpg, aes(hwy)) + geom_histogram()
ggplot(mpg, aes(hwy)) + stat_ecdf(geom = "step")
```


*The proportion of cars that have a highway mpg of 20 or less is 37.5%.*

### 1.2 (2 pts)

##### Now then, make a density plot of `cty` (city miles-per-gallon) and fill it by `class` of car. Add an alpha value of .8 to increase transparency. Eyeballing the plot, which two classes have the most overlap in their distributions? Which class has the least variation in `cty` mpg and which class has the most? 


```{R}
 ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, fill = class)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.8)

```


*The two classes that overlap the most in their distributions are the suv and pickup. Subcompact has the least variation and the 2 seater has the most variation in their distributions.*


### 1.3 (2 pts) 

##### Take your density plot from 1.2 and use `facet_grid()` to create a separate row for each `class` (remove alpha here if you want). Next, add the argument `scales="free_y"` to `facet_grid()` and describe in words what effect it has (compared to leaving it off) and how it could be potentially misleading.

```{R}
ggplot(mpg, aes(cty, fill = class)) + geom_density() + 
    facet_grid(class ~ ., scales = "free_y")
```

*The effect of adding ‘scales = “free y”’ makes the y axis have free scale and while making the x axis fixed, which disorts the scaling of the density charts that could be misleading.*


### 1.4 (2 pts) 

##### Finally, make a two-dimensional density plot (using, e.g., `geom_density2d_filled`) to visualize the joint distribution of `cty` and `hwy`. Add `geom_jitter()` to show the data points but give a slight amount of random noise vertically and horizontally so that the points don't totally overlap. Describe which areas of the plot show the greatest density of cars and which show the least density of cars in terms of their city and highway mpg.

```{R}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + geom_density2d_filled() + 
    geom_jitter(position = position_jitter(height = 3, 
        width = 3))
```

*The graph is more populated towards the lower left-hand corner and middle.*


## Question 2

### 2.1 (1.5 pts) 

##### Assume diastolic blood pressure is normally distributed in a certain population, with a mean of 67 mmHg and a standard deviation 13 mmHg. Use `pnorm()` to compute the probability of obtaining a value less than 60 mmHg from this distribution. Use `pnorm()` again to compute the probability of obtaining a value greater than 85 mmHg from this distribution. Finally, use `qnorm()` to find the 98th percentile of this distribution (the value which cuts of 98% of the distribution below it).

```{R}
pnorm(60, mean = 67, sd = 13, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
1 - pnorm(85, mean = 67, sd = 13)
qnorm(0.98, mean = 67, sd = 13)
```


### 2.2 (1.5 pts) 

##### Below, we set the seed to 322 with `set.seed()` so our random draws match. With `rnorm()` take a sample of size 10000 (ten thousand) draws from a normal distribution with a mean of 67 and a standard deviation of 13. Using `mean()` on a logical vector, what proportion of the total draws are less than 60? What proportion are greater than 85? Using `quantile()`, What value in your sample represents the 98th percentile?


```{R}
set.seed(322)  #leave this line alone

samp <- rnorm(n = 10000, mean = 67, sd = 13)
mean(samp < 60)
quantile(samp, 0.98)
```

The proportion of total draws less than 60 is 25.7%, and the proportion for total draws that are greater than 85 is 65.7%, the value in the sample that represents the 98th percentile is 364.




### 2.3 (1 pts) 

##### Hopefully you see the correspondence between question 2.1 and question 2.2 Why are your answers to question 2.2 close to those in question 2.1 but not exactly the same?

*There are some differences as the qnorm and pnorm used the standard deviation and mean values with the distribution while the quantile() doesnt’.*


## Question 3

### 3.1 (2 pts) 

##### Using `dplyr` functions (filter, summarize; do not use any [] or $) and the `quakes` dataset, What is the mean of the variable `mag` when `depth` is *greater than* the median depth? What is the mean of the variable `mag` when `depth` is *less than* the median depth?

```{R}
library(dplyr)
quakes %>% filter(depth > median(depth)) %>% summarize(mean(mag))
quakes %>% filter(depth < median(depth)) %>% summarize(mean(mag))
```

### 3.2 (1 pts) 

##### Using `dplyr` and the `quakes` dataset, create a new variable called `depth_m` that gives `depth` in meters rather than kilometers. Use `mutate()` *only once* to achieve this! Do not use any [] or $.

```{R}
quakes %>% mutate(depth_m = depth * 1000) %>% head

```

### 3.3 (1 pts) 

##### Finally, using ggplot, take the quakes dataset and make a scatterplot of `long` (x-axis) and `lat` (y-axis) and color the points by `depth`. Add `coord_map()` to scale axes with mercator projection (if this doesn't work, use coord_fixed to make x- and y-axis scales the same). Optionally, add the extra code below to overlay world map data for this region using the code provided below.

```{R}
library(tidyverse)
library(maps)  #install.packages('maps') if not on the servers
world <- map_data("world")

ggplot(quakes) + geom_point(aes(long, lat, color = depth)) + 
    geom_polygon(aes(long, lat, group = group), data = world, 
        fill = "red") + xlim(150, 200) + ylim(-50, 
    0) + coord_map()+geom_polygon(aes(long, lat, group=group), data = world, fill = "red") + xlim(150,200)+ylim(-50,0)
```
