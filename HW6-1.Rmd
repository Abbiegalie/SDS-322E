## Question 1:

##### Load the package nycflights13 with library(nycflights13). If you are not on the servers, you will need to install this package before you can use it! 

##### Run the included code chunk below to save flights and airports to your environment.

```{R}
# install.packages("nycflights13")
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)

flights<-flights
airports<-airports
airlines<-airlines
```

##### Explore the `flights` dataset (e.g., run `glimpse(flights)` read the description of each variable in the help by running `?flights`). Notice how many rows/observations there are: That's how many flights left the three big NYC airports in 2013!

### 1.1 (2 pts) 

##### Report the number and proportion of NAs for each variable using summarize_all() and/or mutate_all(). Ideally, you will write your own short function(s) to count NAs and apply it to every column via `summarize_all`, but there are other ways.

```{R}
glimpse(flights)
flights %>% select(everything()) %>% summarize_all(function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```
The number of NAs for the variable dep_time is 8255: 336,776, dep_daly is 8255:336,776 , arr_Time 8713:336,776 , arr_delay 9430:336,776 , tailnum 2512:336,776 , air_time 9430:336,776. The other variables do not contain any NAs.

### 1.2 (2 pts) 

##### Remove all rows containing NAs from the dataset (**for the rest of the assignment, we will be using only the complete rows, so overwrite the `flights` dataset or save it as a new object and use it in place of `flights` from here on out**). Now, using filter, what airport `dest`ination (three-letter code fine) has the longest `air_time`? 

```{R}
flights <- flights %>% filter(complete.cases(flights))
flights %>% filter(air_time == max(air_time)) %>% select(dest)
```
The destination that has the longest air time is HNL.



### 1.3 (4 pts) 

##### Find the mean, standard deviation, count, and standard error of `distance` in each month (i.e., averaged across `day`) for flights from the three different New York airports (`origin`). You will use your sd and count to find your se=sd/sqrt(count). Rename your summary variables inside of `summarize()`. 

```{R}
flights %>% group_by(month, origin) %>% summarize(mean_distance = mean(distance), 
    sd = sd(distance), count = n(), se = sd/sqrt(count))

```

### 1.4 (4 pts) 

##### Using your results from part 1.3, make a barplot of mean distance for each month using `ggplot()`. Add manual standard error bars using geom_errorbar() by specifying `aes(x=month, y=your_mean, ymin=your_mean-your_se, ymax=your_mean+your_se)`. Facet (or equivalent) by `origin` and provide labels/ticks on the x-axis for each month. Write a bit about what you see!

```{R}
flights %>% group_by(month, origin) %>% summarize(mean_dist = mean(distance), 
    sd = sd(distance), count = n(), se = sd/sqrt(count)) %>% 
    ggplot(., aes(x = month, y = mean_dist)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
    geom_errorbar(aes(x = month, y = mean_dist, ymin = mean_dist - 
        se, ymax = mean_dist + se)) + facet_wrap(. ~ 
    origin, scales = "free_x")
```


*The results show that JFK had the greatest mean distance in flights and LGA had the least mean distance in flights out of the airports in New York for the year of 2013.*

## Question 2 (2 pts)

Let's do some joining! The dataset `airlines` contains the full name of the carrier (examine it!). Join the dataset with the flights dataset so all of the information in `flights` is retained. Using the merged dataset, which carrier (`name`) has the longest average departure delay? Which has the shortest?

```{R}
airlines %>% full_join(flights, by = "carrier") %>% 
    arrange(., desc(dep_delay))
airlines %>% full_join(flights, by = "carrier") %>% 
    arrange(., dep_delay)
```


*The longest average departure delay comes from the Hawaain Airlines. The shortest average departure delay comes from JetBlue Airways.*


## Question 3 


### 3.1 (4 pts) 

##### Look at the dataset called `airports`. How many rows does it have? How many unique airports (variable `faa`)? Using methods we have seen/discussed (e.g., `%in%` with `sum()` or `mean()`, set operations, joins), how many of these airports (variable `faa`) appear in the `flights` dataset as destinations (variable `dest`)? How many unique destination airports are there in the flights dataset? Which destination airports are in the `flights` dataset but missing from the `airports` dataset? Google those airport codes: what do they have in common?

```{R}
airports %>% nrow()
airports %>% distinct(faa) %>% semi_join(flights, c(faa = "dest"))

flights %>% distinct(dest)
flights %>% distinct(dest) %>% anti_join(airports, 
    c(dest = "faa"))
```

*There are 1458 rows in the airport dataset. There are 1458 unique airports in the airports data set. However the amount that are in the flights dataset is only 100. There are 104 unique destination airports in the flights dataset. The ones missing from the airports dataset tare the BQN, SJU, STT, and PSE airports. The airport codes all have in common that they are in unincorporated territories of the United States.*

### 3.2 (2 pts) 

##### Do a join that results in a dataset that contains only the rows with matches (i.e., none of the airports not appearing in `flights`, none of the destinations not appearing in `airports`). Call `glimpse()` on this final dataset (please don't print the whole thing out).

```{R}
flights %>% left_join(airports, by = c(dest = "faa")) %>% 
    left_join(airports, by = c(origin = "faa")) %>% 
    glimpse()

```
*There are 327,346 rows and 33 columns.*
