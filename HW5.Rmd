## Question 1

### 1.1 (2 pts)

###### All subsequent code will be done using the tidyverse (with a focus on `dplyr`), so we need to load this package. We also want to look at the `penguins` dataset which is inside the palmerpenguins package, so we can grab this as well

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
penguins <- palmerpenguins::penguins
```

###### Using the function `filter()`, pick all the rows/observaions in the `penguins` dataset from the year 2007 and store the result as a new object called `penguins_2007`. Compare the number of observations/rows in the original `penguins` dataset with your new `penguins_2007` dataset in words.

```{R}
penguins_2007 <- filter(penguins, year %in% (2007))
penguins_2007
```

*The number of rows in the penguins dataset was 344, and after in the penguins_2007 dataset there was way less, around 110 rows.*

### 1.2 (1 pt)

###### Return all the rows in the `penguins_2007` dataset where `bill_length_mm` is between 45 and 55, (doesn't matter if inclusive of 45 and 55 or not, since no observations have those exact values).

```{R}
filter(penguins_2007, bill_length_mm %in% c(45:55))

```

### 1.3 (1 pt)

###### Are there any cases in the `penguins_2007` dataset for which the ratio of `bill_length_mm` to `bill_depth_mm` exceeds 3.5? For now, use only `filter()` to find out. If so, for which species of penguins is this true?

```{R}
filter(penguins_2007, bill_length_mm/bill_depth_mm > 
    3.5)

```
*This is true for the Gentoo species of penguins*

### 1.4 (1 pt)

###### Take your `penguins_2007` dataset and using `select()`, drop/delete the column `year`, since it isn't necessary. Overwrite the `penguins_2007` dataset so it no longer contains that column.

```{R}
penguins_2007 %>% select(-year)

```

## Question 2

### 2.1 (1 pt)

###### Using the function `mutate()`, take `penguins_2007` and create a new data column that contains the ratio of `bill_length_mm` to `bill_depth_mm` (call it `bill_ratio`). Overwrite `penguins_2007` so it contains this new column

```{R}
penguins_2007 <- penguins_2007 %>% mutate(bill_ratio = bill_length_mm/bill_depth_mm)

```

### 2.2 (2 pts)

###### Take the `penguins_2007` data and, using `group_by` along with either `arrange` and `slice` or `slice_min`, for *each species* find the three penguins with the shortest bill length. Of those 9 penguins, how many have the value female for the sex variable? 


```{R}
penguins_2007 %>% arrange(desc(bill_length_mm)) %>% 
    group_by(species) %>% slice(1:3) %>% filter(sex == 
    "female")
```

*Only 1 penguin has the value female for the sex variable.*

## Question 3

### 3.1 (2 pts)

Using `penguins_2007`, calculate the mean and standard deviation of `bill_ratio` each species using `group_by` and `summarize`. Drop NAs from `bill_ratio` for these computations (e.g., using the argument na.rm=T) so you have values for each species. Which species has the greatest average `bill_ratio`?

```{R}
penguins_2007 %>% group_by(species) %>% summarize(mean_ratio = mean(bill_ratio, 
    na.rm = T), sd_ratio = sd(bill_ratio, na.rm = T))

```

*The species with the greatest average bill_ratio is Gentoo.*

### 3.2 (1 pts)

With `penguins_2007`, using either `summarize(n())` or using `count`, report the number of observations for each species-island combination (note that you'll need to group by both variables!). Which species appears on all three islands? 

```{R}
penguins_2007 %>% group_by(species, island) %>% count(species, 
    island)

```

*The Adelie species is in all islands.*


## Question 4

### 4.1 (2 pts)

Take the `penguins_2007` data set you have created and using `ggplot` create a single plot showing the distribution of `body_mass_g` for male and female penguins separately, faceted by species (use facet_grid to give each species its own row). Which species has the most NAs for `sex`? Which species shows the least sexual dimorphism (i.e., which shows the greatest overlap of male/female size distributions)?

```{R warning=F}
penguins_2007 %>% ggplot(aes(body_mass_g, group = sex)) + 
    geom_density(aes(color = sex)) + facet_grid(~species)
```

*The group with the most NAs for sex is Adelie and the Chinstrap group has the least sexual dimorphism*

### 4.2 (2 pts)

###### Now, take `penguins_2007` and, using `ggplot`, create a scatterplot of `flipper_length_mm` (x-axis) against the `bill_ratio` variable. Does it look like there is a relationship between length-to-depth ratio and the lengths? To see more clearly, add `geom_smooth(method="lm")` to the plot.

```{R}
penguins_2007 %>% ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, 
    y = bill_ratio)) + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

*There looks to be a positive correlation between bill_ratio and filpper length.*

### 4.3 (2 pts)

###### Does your answer change when you consider each species individually instead of all together? To see more clearly, duplicate the plot from before but additionally, in the main `ggplot()` function, map `species` to color so each species gets its own color and regression trendline.

###### Compare this plot with the previous one (in 4.2) and discuss whether the relationship between flipper length and bill length-to-depth ratio changes when you look at it overall versus within each species.

```{R}
penguins_2007 %>% ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, 
    y = bill_ratio, color = species)) + geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
    geom_point()


```

*It seems like there is less distinction of a positive correlation between having a greater flipper length if there is a high bill ratio with gentoo having the greatest bill ratio.*

### 4.4 (3 pts)

###### Finally, let's make a plot using the original `penguins` dataset (not just the 2007 data). Forewarning: This will be very busy plot!

###### Map `body_mass_g` to the x-axis, `flipper_length_mm` to the y-axis, `species` to color, and `island` to shape and make a scatterplot. Using facet_wrap, facet the plots by `year`. Find a way to clean up the x-axis labels using scale_x_continuous (either include fewer breaks, e.g., with n.breaks=3, or rotate the ones that are there). 

###### Does there appear to be a relationship between body mass and flipper length overall? Is there a relationship within each species?

###### What happens to the distribution of flipper lengths for species over time (do you see more or less species overlap for this variable in 2007 relative to 2009)?


```{R}
penguins %>% ggplot(aes(x = body_mass_g, y = flipper_length_mm, 
    color = species, shape = island)) + geom_point() + 
    facet_wrap(~year) + scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 3)

```

*Overtime, less species overlap with their flipper length.*
